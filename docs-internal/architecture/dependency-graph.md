# Dependency graph

Which Use Cases call which Facades. Update this whenever a feature or use case is added.

The audit log is **infrastructure**, not a feature: it lives in `src/lib/activity` beside
`lib/auth-guards` and `lib/mailer`, so any layer may write a history line. That is why
`change-member-role`, `submit-pilot-applications` and `claim-account` are gone — each
coordinated exactly one feature plus the log, which AGENTS.md says is not a use case. Their
logic sits in the facade that owns the domain rule (`membership.changeMemberRole` carries the
"cannot change your own role" rule; `accounts.claimAccount` the claim), and the Action calls
that facade directly.

> Newly qualifying for the same treatment: `manage-chapter` and `manage-country` now touch
> only `chapters` plus the log, so both could collapse into their Actions or into the
> `chapters` facade. Left as-is deliberately — the facade already exports thin
> `createChapter`/`updateChapter`/`deleteChapter` wrappers, so merging them is a naming
> decision rather than a mechanical move.

| Use case | Facades it coordinates | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build-session-access` | `chapters`, `membership` | The session payload needs the user's country-admin scopes (chapters) *and* their chapter memberships (membership). Two facades → a use case. |
| `onboarding-progress` | `chapters`, `membership`, `profile` | How far someone got is spread across three tables: which chapter they joined, what they consented to, whether a rider profile exists. Read by the `/onboarding` resolver and by every step that draws the progress dots. |
| `settle-passenger-location` | `membership`, `profile` | "Where do you live" and "which chapter serves you" are one answer given on one screen, but two features own the two halves. |
| `accept-onboarding-consent` | `membership`, `profile` | Records consent and, when a QR preset skipped the location step, performs the join it would have done. |
| `complete-onboarding-profile` | `chapters`, `membership`, `passengers`, `profile` | Writes the account's own details, creates the rider profile a ride will point at, resolves the chapter, and sends the welcome mail. |
| `decide-pilot-application` | `activity`, `chapters`, `membership`, `profile` | One approval writes the decision, the granted role, the history events and the applicant's email — in the applicant's own locale, so the profile is read too. |
| `manage-country-admins` | `activity`, `chapters`, `profile` | Country-admin rows belong to `chapters`, the email lookup to `profile`, and the audit line to `activity`. |
| `provision-assisted-passenger` | `accounts`, `membership`, `passengers`, `activity` | One "add a passenger at the door" makes the account, joins the chapter, creates the rider row and records who created it — four features, and the helper rule decides whether the rider row points at the new account or at nobody. |
| `invite-chapter-user` | `accounts`, `chapters`, `membership`, `profile` (+ `activity`, `mailer`) | Provisioning the account, granting the chapter role, and mailing the invitation in the invitee's own locale (hence `profile`) are three features plus infrastructure. |
| `manage-chapter` | `chapters`, `activity` | Creating, editing or deleting a chapter is a `chapters` write plus the history line that makes it legible on the chapter's own page. `chapters.diffChapter` turns one autosave into one `chapterUpdated` event per field that actually changed (a moved pin and its new address fold into one `location` change), and the delete event is recorded *global* because the row it would point at is gone. |
| `manage-country` | `chapters`, `activity` | Deleting a country takes every chapter under it (the relation restricts, so the service deletes both in one transaction) and writes the history: one `countryDeleted` line plus a `chapterDeleted` line per chapter, all recorded *global* because the rows they would point at are gone. |

No use case was added for the admin shell. `G --> F1` now carries two guards:
`requireChapterAdmin` (`chapters.getChapterCountryId`) and `requireAdminScope`
(`chapters.listCountries` + `chapters.listChapters`). Resolving the admin scope needs the
`chapters` facade and nothing else, so per AGENTS.md it collapsed into `lib/auth-guards`
rather than becoming a use case — the same call the `requireChapterAdmin` precedent already
makes. If it ever needs a second facade (say, membership counts per chapter), that is when it
graduates to `src/use-cases/`.

The `CM*` nodes are the ⌘K contributions, not a new layer: `app/admin/commands` imports each
slice's `commands.ts` and merges it into the palette. They sit in the Features subgraph
because they are part of the slice's public surface — `eslint.config.mjs` lists
`src/features/*/{facade,index,commands}.ts` as the `feature-facade` element — and they import
nothing but types, so no edge leaves them.

Single-facade work has no use case: `lib/auth-guards` calls `chapters.getChapterCountryId`
and `profile.getProfile` (the admin passkey gate) directly, `app/admin/chapters/actions` calls
the chapters facade directly, `features/membership/actions` calls the membership facade
directly, and the passkey and pilot-next-steps actions call the profile facade directly.

`features/accounts` (F6) has no UI of its own either — its Server Actions (ACT8) are imported
straight into the admin passengers and members screens, because "provision a user" is not a
page. `app/admin/members/actions` also calls `accounts.deleteUser` directly (`ACT5 --> F6`):
the hard delete touches one feature — the schema cascades everything else — so it is an
Action behind `requireSuperAdmin`, not a use case. `S6` is the only place outside `prisma/seed.ts` that calls BetterAuth's admin API
(`auth.api.createUser`); everything else in that slice is ordinary Prisma.
`accounts.claimAccount` is called from the onboarding consent action (ACT3), not from the
admin shell: the account is claimed by the person who received it, at the one step nobody may
take on their behalf.

`lib/activity` (F5) is cross-cutting infrastructure, the same standing as `lib/auth-guards`
and `lib/mailer`: a facade, a use case or a Server Component may write a history line, and it
owns no domain of its own. Writes sit next to the mutation they record; the only reads are the
person-history feed on `/admin/members/[userId]` and the chapter history on
`/admin/chapters/[chapterId]`, both straight from the Server Component.

`lib/mapbox` and `lib/mailer` are cross-cutting infrastructure, callable from any layer — the
same standing as `lib/prisma` and `lib/sms`. `lib/mapbox` is reached only from a Server Action
so the secret token never enters a client bundle — the location flow's actions (ACT2) and the
admin chapter actions (ACT6: suggest, retrieve and reverse-geocode behind `requireAdminScope`
and a per-user rate limit) are its two callers.
